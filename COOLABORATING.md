# 🤝 Contributing to Python Concepts Learning Repository

Welcome to our **Python Concepts Learning** repository! 🚀 We appreciate your interest in contributing to this open-source project, where we collaboratively build and share examples of Python concepts and simple examples of code.

## 📜 Contribution Guidelines

To ensure consistency and maintainability, please follow these guidelines when contributing:

### 📂 Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
```
Concepts/
│── Tuples/
│   ├── tuple_example.py
│   ├── another_tuple_example.py
│── Lists/
│   ├── list_example.py
│── Decorators/
│   ├── decorator_example.py
│── YourConceptSuggestion/  <-- Add a new Directory for a new concept.
│   ├── example_or_explanation.py <-- Add an example of code for that concept, you can add explanations inside.
README.md
COOLABORATING.md
```
Each Python concept has its own subdirectory, containing well-structured Python script files demonstrating real-world examples and useful cases, or just for didactic purposes.
